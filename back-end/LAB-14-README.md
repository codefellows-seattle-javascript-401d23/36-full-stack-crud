======

## Submission Instructions
* Continue working from lab 13
* Submit on canvas a question and observation, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request

## Resources
* [express docs](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)
* [mongoose guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)
* [mongoose api docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html)

## Feature Tasks  
#### Second Model
In the model/ directory create a second Model for a resource using Mongoose (that is different from the class lecture resource). The model must include 4 properties, two of which should be required. It should be the `Many` in a `One to Many` model relationship.

#### Server Endpoints
Create the following routes for performing CRUD opperations on your resourcee
* `POST /<resource-name>` 
  * pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a **POST** request to create a new resource
  * on success respond with a 200 status code and the created note 
  * on failure due to a bad request send a 400 status code
* `GET /<resource-name>/:id` 
  * should respond with the resource on success
    * if the id is not found respond with a 404
* `DELETE /<resource-name>/:id` 
  * the route should delete a note with the given id 
  * on success this should return a 204 status code with no content in the body
  * on failure due to a resource with that id not existing respond with a 404 status code

## Tests
* Write tests to ensure the `/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
* POST should test for 200, 400, and 409 (if any keys are unique)
* GET should test for 200 and 404
* DELETE should test for 204 and 404

## Documentation
In the README.md write documention for starting your server and making requests to each endpoint it provides. The documentaion should describe how the server would respond to valid and invalid requests.

## Stretch Goal
* Create and test a PUT route for your second resource
